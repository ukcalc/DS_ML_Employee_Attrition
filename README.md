# DS_ML_Employee_Attrition
The historical data of a company such as Age, Business Travel, Education, Job Role, Distance from office and all other factors affecting attrition of employees. 
The goal is to predict attrition of an employee using classification models i.e. LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier.

Conclusions:
1. RandomForestClassifier is the best-fit model with accuracy score of 0.9972 and precision score of 0.9987 and good Recall Score of 98.56%

2. DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier are marginally overfitted model.

3. Hyperparameter tuning slightly increases the Recall and F1 scores. Since the model is 99% accurate, there is not much need of tuning.
